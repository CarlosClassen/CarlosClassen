Hello you, I am Carlos! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm passionate about science and currently study at RWTH Aachen University. 🎓

You can often find me tinkering with computer hardware/software and microelectronics, but I really burn for research in the intersection of informatics, biology and medicine! 🧪🧬🔬

I strongly believe in the importance of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) distributed data to create science for everyone. 🌍✨

🌟 Unusual and seemingly mad ideas truly pique my interest! So, if you have any offbeat concepts that you'd like to collaborate on, count me in!

✉️ I'm always excited to connect with new people, so don't hesitate to reach out! 

Stay curious! 🌈🔍
